The Staff Importer tool requires a specific format in order to properly identify
and import the staff information. The first line is a header row that works to
inform the user of the expected format and must be present. Each following line
of the file corresponds to the information for a single staff member to be
imported. The format is as follows:

First Name , Last Name , Email , Start Date , Color , Role

Each value must be separated by a comma (,) and must be in the order outlined
above. It may be easier to think of this format as an Excel sheet where each
block is separated by a comma.

Failure to adhere to this format could result in information regarding staff
members being mixed up or no information being imported altogether. NOTE: All of
these values can be changed after the import by going to the 'Edit Staff' page.

Below is a breakdown of what each of the above values represent and how they can
be formatted.

First Name : The first name of the staff member. Can be up to 20 characters long

Last Name : The last name of the staff member. Can be up to 50 characters long

Email : The email of the staff member. This is the email the staff member will use
         to sign in to the Duty Scheduling Application.

Start Date : The date that the staff member started their role. This must be in
              the following format: MM/DD/YYYY . For example 01/01/2020

Color : The color associated with this staff member's duty events. This will
         help the staff member locate their duties on the calendar. This must be
         represented in a hexadecimal format that is preceded by a '#'.

         For example: #000000 , #FFFFFF , or #123456

         For assistance in finding these values, there are hex color pickers
         online that will allow you to select the desired color and it will
         provide the associated hexadecimal value.

Role : The role of the staff member. This must be one of three possible values:
        RA  - Resident Assistant
        AHD - Assistant Hall Director
        HD  - Hall Director / Area Coordinator

        These roles determine what authorization level the staff member has and
        what the staff member has access to within the application. The RA role
        is only authorized for the basic functionality whereas the HD role has
        the most access across the application.

The remainder of this file can be used as a template for creating the .csv file.
Using the header line below, enter the information for each staff member in the
following lines. When you are ready to import, simply delete all of these
instructions so that the header line is the first line of the file and save.
Then follow the instructions in the 'Edit Staff' page to import the staff!


First Name , Last Name , Email , Start Date , Color , Role
Example , Name , name@example.com, 01/01/2020 , #000000 , RA
