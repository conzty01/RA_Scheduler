## API Methods
The following are the API methods which are available in this 
blueprint.


### [/getRABreakStats](https://localhost:5000/breaks/api/getRABreakStats)
API Method that will calculate a staff's RA Break Duty statistics for the given
time period. This method does not calculate the number of points an RA has
due to breaks, but rather counts the number of break duties the RA has been
assigned to for the given time period.

Required Auth Level (Role): _**None**_ <br />
Accepted Method(s): _**GET**_

If called from the server, this function accepts the following parameters:

| Name         | Type    | Description  |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| hallId       | `<int>` | An integer representing the id of the desired residence hall in the res_hall table.|
| startDateStr | `<str>` | A string representing the first day that should be included for the duty points calculation.|
| endDateStr   | `<str>` | A string representing the last day that should be included for the duty points calculation.|

If called from a client, the following parameters are required:

| Name  | Type    | Description  |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| start | `<str>` | A string representing the first day that should be included for the break duty count calculation.|
| end   | `<str>` | A string representing the last day that should be included for the duty count calculation.|

This method returns an object with the following specifications:
```
{
    <ra.id 1> : {
        "name": ra.first_name + " " + ra.last_name,
        "count": <number of break duties RA 1 has>
    },
    <ra.id 2> : {
        "name": ra.first_name + " " + ra.last_name,
        "count": <number of break duties RA 2 has>
    },
    ...
}
```


### [/getBreakDuties](https://localhost:5000/breaks/api/getBreakDuties)
API Method that will calculate a staff's RA Break Duty statistics for the given
time period. This method does not calculate the number of points an RA has
due to breaks, but rather counts the number of break duties the RA has been
assigned to for the given time period.

Required Auth Level (Role): _**≥ AHD**_ <br />
Accepted Method(s): _**GET**_

If called from the server, this function accepts the following parameters:

| Name          | Type     | Description  |
|---------------|----------|--------------|
| hallId        | `<int>`  | An integer representing the id of the desired residence hall in the `res_hall` table.|
| start         | `<str>`  | A string representing the first day that should be included for the returned duty schedule.|
| end           | `<str>`  | A string representing the last day that should be included for the returned duty schedule.|
| showAllColors | `<bool>` | A boolean value representing whether the returned duty schedule should include the RA's `ra.color` value or if the generic value `#2C3E50` should be returned. Setting this value to True will return the RA's `ra.color` value. By default this parameter is set to False. |
| raId          | `<int>`  | An integer representing the id of the RA that should be considered the requesting user. By default this value is set to -1 which indicates that no RA should be considered the requesting user.|

If called from a client, the following parameters are required:

| Name      | Type     | Description  |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| start     |  `<str>` | A string representing the first day that should be included for the returned duty schedule.|
| end       |  `<str>` | A string representing the last day that should be included for the returned duty schedule.|
| allColors | `<bool>` | A boolean value representing whether the returned duty schedule should include the RA's `ra.color` value or if the generic value `#2C3E50` should be returned. Setting this value to True will return the RA's `ra.color` value.|

_NOTE: Regardless of what value is specified for allColors, the if the ra.id
        that is associated with the user appears in the break schedule, the
        ra.color associated with the user will be displayed. This is so that
        the user can more easily identify when they are on duty._

This method returns an object with the following specifications:
```
[
    {
        "id": <ra.id>,
        "title": <ra.first_name + " " + ra.last_name>,
        "start": <string value of day.date associated with the scheduled duty>,
        "color": <ra.color OR #2C3E50 if allColors/showAllColors is False>,
