    # The breakdown of the parameters that this algorithm accepts is as follows:

    #     raList      = list containing RA objects that are to be scheduled
    #     year        = year for scheduling
    #     month       = month for scheduling

    #                    should be on duty.

    #                    up with the representation that is in the datetime
    #                    module. The mapping is as follows:
