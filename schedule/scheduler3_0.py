    # This algorithm will schedule RAs for duties based on ...
    #
    # The algorithm returns a Schedule object that contains Day objects which, in
    #  turn, contain RA objects that have been scheduled for that day.
    #
    # The breakdown of the parameters that this algorithm accepts is as follows:
    #
    #     raList        = list containing RA objects that are to be scheduled
    #     year          = year for scheduling
    #     month         = month for scheduling
    #     noDutyDates   = list of Date objects that represent dates where no RAs
    #                      should be on duty.
    #     doubleDays    = set containing integers denoting the day of the week
    #                      where multiple RAs should be scheduled. These integers
    #                      line up with the representation that is in the datetime
    #                      module. The mapping is as follows:
    #
    #                       Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun
    #                        0    1     2     3     4    5    6
    #
    #     doublePts     = number of points that are earned on a double day
    #     doubleNum     = number of RAs to be assigned on a double day
    #     doubleDates   = set containing integers denoting the date of the month
    #                      where multiple RAs should be assigned. This is different
    #                      than the 'doubleDays' set in that it represents *dates*
    #                      where multiple RAs should be assigned-- not *days of the
    #                      week*. If a date happens to be in both the doubleDates
    #                      set and the doubleDays set, it acts like a double day.
    #     doubleDateNum = number of RAs to be assigned on a double date
    #     doubleDatePts = number of points that are earned on a double date
    #     ldaTolerance  = number of days before an RA is to be considered for duty
    #     nddTolerance  = tolerance for whether an RA should be considered for
    #                      duty on a double day. This tolerance helps prevent RAs
    #                      from being scheduled for two consective double days in
    #                      a row since they could be many days apart
    #     prevDuties    = list containing tuples of an RA object and date object
    #                      that cooresponds with the last few days of duty of the
    #                      previous month. This helps prevent RAs from being
    #                      assigned for duties in close succession at the
    #                      change of the month.
