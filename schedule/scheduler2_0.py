    # The scheduler uses a dfs traversal of a graph to
    # generate a ra_sched Schedule according to the
    # following schema:

    # The graph will be comprised of vertices which
    # represent the days of a month that should have
    # a duty shift scheduled. Each vertex is connected
    # by an edge which represents a duty shift.

    # Traversing an edge means assigning a duty shift to
    # a particular RA. Assigning an RA to a duty shift
    # will be determined based on a cost calculated
    # at the time of traversal. This is done because
    # the cost of choosing a particular RA will change
    # for each day.

        #     distance from the mean point value
        # 2  The proximity to the last time the RA was
        #     assigned duty
        # 3  The number of times the RA was already
        #     assigned duty for a similar day of the
        #     week (weekdays vs weekends)
        # 4  The number of times the RA was already
